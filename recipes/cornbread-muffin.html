        <h1>Cornbread Muffin</h1>
        <img src="../recipes/muffin.webp" height="250"/>
        <p>If you enjoy sweet cornbread, I think you'll like these a lot! This recipe made a usually dry boxed cornbread moister and more flavorful. It was a tad too sweet for us, I would make this again but cut out the additional sugar.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2(7.5 ounce) packages corn bread mix</li>
                 <li> 1/2 cup milk</li>
                <li>1.2 cup sour cream</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons honeyt</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners.</li>
                <li>Mix corn bread mix, milk, sour cream, honey, and eggs in a bowl until batter is well combined yet slightly lumpy; allow to rest for 5 minutes. Fill muffin cups 3/4 full with batter. Lightly sprinkle each muffin with sugar.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until muffins are golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Brush tops of muffins with melted butter; repeat brushing muffins with butter 2 to 3 more times.</li>
