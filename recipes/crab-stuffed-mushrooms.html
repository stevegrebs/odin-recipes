    <h1>Crab Stuffed Mushrooms</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/crab-stuffed-mushrooms.webp" height="250"/>
    <p>This tasty appetizer seasoned with thyme, oregano, and savory. Choose good sized mushrooms, about 2 inches across. When cleaning mushrooms, don't run them under water. They are like little sponges, and will absorb it; just wipe them clean with a damp towel. The filling can be made with fresh, canned, or imitation crabmeat. If using canned, be sure to rinse it first.</p>
